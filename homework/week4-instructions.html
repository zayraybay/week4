    <h1 class="text-4xl my-4">Week 4 Homework</h1>
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p>Your hot new rideshare startup, Noober, has launched its MVP and is quickly becoming a viable competitor in the market. However, you've received initial feedback from users and it's clear that showing drivers random rides from all parts of the city has proven challenging for drivers, and is causing long wait times for riders. The team has decided to pivot to a UX where all available rides are shown at once.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Getting Started</h3>
      <p>Begin by heading over to <a href="https://github.com/kiei451-winter2021/noober-week4" class="text-pink-500 underline">the starter project</a> – select "Use this template", then create a repository in your own GitHub account called <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">noober-week4</span>.</p>
      <p>Open <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">index.html</span> in Chrome. You'll see that your design team has put together a prototype of what the new UI should look like, with a few hard-coded examples. Your job is to make the page read the dynamic data that's been made available by your back-end development team and display it on the page.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">The Goal</h3>
      <p>The page should read the real data, found at <a href="https://kiei451.com/api/rides.json" class="text-pink-500 underline">https://kiei451.com/api/rides.json</a>. The work to do this is already provided – simply use the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">json</span> variable. The provided code writes out the value of this variable to the JavaScript Console in Chrome – inspect the structure of this data using the Console. Your job is to extract the data from this Object, transform it into HTML/Tailwind code that meets the design team's specifications, and append it to the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">div</span> with the class name <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">rides</span>.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Rubric</h3>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>(3 points) Loop through all of the available rides contained within the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">json</span> variable provided. Each element of the Array is another Array containing the "legs" of the ride. As in the last homework, any ride with more than one leg is considered a "Noober Pool". Traverse this data – you will need more than one loop (3 points) – print the level of service and information on the ride as illustrated by the design mockup (3 points). <em>Remember that we're simply working with strings that contain HTML. For each iteration of the loop, you will need to construct two strings that will be inserted into the HTML element with the class name <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">rides</span> – one for the level of service and another for the 1-or-more legs of the ride.</em>
        <li>(1 point) Empty the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">rides</span> div element; you should be left with only an empty <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">div</span> element in your HTML, but a page full of data.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Guidelines for Submission</h3>
      <p>All your work should take place in <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">noober.js</span>; i.e. that should be the only file that's modified from the original project template. Your finished product should live in your GitHub account at <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">https://github.com/&lt;your GitHub username&gt;/noober-week4</span>, and <strong>this URL should be submitted as the "website URL" for this assignment in Canvas.</strong></p>
