// Week 4 lab â€“ Similar to last week's lab â€“Â but without the help!

// The provided code now goes out to the Internet to get our products data.
// You can visit the provided URL â€“ https://kiei451.com/api/products.jsonÂ â€“
// in Chrome to see what the data looks like.

// Write a loop to iterate through the product data; each iteration of the loop
// should call a function called renderProduct, which accepts an object representing
// a single product object as input, and appends HTML to an existing element on the page
// with the class "products". You can use the existing HTML in the "products" element
// as a template, deleting it when you're finished.

// ðŸ”¥ define your renderProduct function here

async function pageLoaded() {
  let response = await fetch('https://kiei451.com/api/products.json')
  let json = await response.json()

  // writes the returned JSON to the console
  console.log(json)
  
  // ðŸ”¥ start here: write code to loop through the products; each
  // iteration of the loop should call your renderProduct function
  // make it work first; then extract to the separate renderProduct
  // function after it's 100% working without it
